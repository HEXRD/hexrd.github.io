    "authors": "Kirstein, Tom, Petrich, Lukas, Purushottam Raj Purohit, Ravi Raj Purohit, Micha, Jean-Sébastien, Schmidt, Volker",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Laue microdiffraction is an X-ray diffraction technique that allows for the non-destructive acquisition of spatial maps of crystallographic orientation and the strain state of (poly)crystalline specimens. To do so, diffraction patterns, consisting of thousands of Laue spots, are collected and analyzed at each location of the spatial maps. Each spot of these so-called Laue patterns has to be accurately characterized with respect to its position, size and shape for subsequent analyses including indexing and strain analysis. In the present paper, several approaches for estimating these descriptors that have been proposed in the literature, such as methods based on image moments or function fitting, are reviewed. However, with the increasing size and quantity of Laue image data measured at synchrotron sources, some datasets become unfeasible in terms of computational requirements. Moreover, for irregular Laue spots resulting, e.g., from overlaps and extended crystal defects, the exact shape and, more importantly, the position are ill-defined. To tackle these shortcomings, a procedure using convolutional neural networks is presented, allowing for a significant acceleration of the characterization of Laue spots, while simultaneously estimating the quality of a Laue spot for further analyses. When tested on unseen Laue spots, this approach led to an acceleration of 77 times using a GPU while maintaining high levels of accuracy.</jats:p>",

In this work, we describe laser-driven shock compression experiments on polycrystalline alumina conducted at the Matter in Extreme Conditions endstation of the Linac Coherent Light Source. Ultrafast x-ray pulses (50 fs, 10<jats:sup>12</jats:sup> photons/pulse) were used to probe the atomic-level response at different times during shock propagation and subsequent pressure release. At 107 ± 8 GPa on the Hugoniot, we observe diffraction peaks that match the orthorhombic Rh<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>(II) phase with a density of 5.16 ± 0.03 g cm<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>. Upon unloading, the material transforms back to the <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>-corundum structure. Upon release to ambient pressure, densities are lower than predicted assuming isentropic release, indicating additional lattice expansion due to plastic work heating. Using temperature values calculated from density measurements, we provide an estimate of alumina’s strength on release from shock compression.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Measured intensity in high-energy monochromatic X-ray diffraction (HEXD) experiments provides information regarding the microstructure of the crystalline material under study. The location of intensity on an areal detector is determined by the lattice spacing and orientation of crystals so that changes in the <jats:italic>heterogeneity</jats:italic> of these quantities are reflected in the spreading of diffraction peaks over time. High temporal resolution of such dynamics can now be experimentally observed using technologies such as the mixed-mode pixel array detector (MM-PAD) which facilitates in situ dynamic HEXD experiments to study plasticity and its underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we define and demonstrate a feature computed directly from such diffraction time series data quantifying signal spread in a manner that is correlated with plastic deformation of the sample. A distinguishing characteristic of the analysis is the capability to describe the evolution from the distinct diffraction peaks of an undeformed alloy sample through to the non-uniform Debye–Scherrer rings developed upon significant plastic deformation. We build on our previous work modeling data using an overcomplete dictionary by treating temporal measurements jointly to improve signal spread recovery. We demonstrate our approach in simulations and on experimental HEXD measurements captured using the MM-PAD. Our method for characterizing the temporal evolution of signal spread is shown to provide an informative means of data analysis that adds to the capabilities of existing methods. Our work draws on ideas from convolutional sparse coding and requires solving a coupled convex optimization problem based on the alternating direction method of multipliers.</jats:p>",

    "title": "<i>In-Situ</i> X-Ray Measurements of Grain Stress and Strain During Uniaxial Compaction of Miniature Sandstone Samples",
    "authors": "Hurley, R. C., Shahin, G.",
    "abstract": "<jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Laboratory rock deformation has been extensively studied using in-situ optical and X-ray imaging and acoustic emissions (AE) measurements. These measurements have revealed rich kinematics across scales during sandstone compaction, from grain-scale breakage to sample-scale shear and compaction bands. Nevertheless, much progress remains in understanding the connection between rock deformation and grain-scale stress evolution before and after yielding and during the onset and progression of sample-scale strain localization. Such an understanding may offer opportunities for new mechanism-based constitutive models and estimation of grain-scale properties such as intra- and inter-granular bond strength. In this work, we describe the first-known simultaneous application of in-situ X-ray tomography and 3D X-ray diffraction to make strain and stress measurements in miniature samples of Nugget and Berea sandstones. This data provides a first quantification of grain-scale stress heterogeneity, grain-scale and inter-granular bond strength, and larger-scale stress heterogeneity during sandstone compaction. We discuss challenges in X- ray tomography and diffraction analyses for sandstones, which are related to challenges in identification of individual grains in tomographic images featuring minimal contrast at grain boundaries and challenges in performing diffraction microscopy from non-ideal diffraction spots generated by natural quartz crystals. We propose methods for examining the strength of inter-granular bonds and relating AE activity to stress fluctuations using our experimental data.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>INTRODUCTION</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Sandstone accommodates macroscopic deformation by a combination of microscopic mechanisms including cement bridge breakage, Hertzian particle fractures, particle crushing and pore collapse, and grain rearrangements (Paterson &amp; Wong, 2005; Wong &amp; Baud, 2012). Heterogeneous structures emerge at all length scales during sandstone compaction – from the contact-scale through cement-bridge breakage and chipping, to the grain-scale through breakage and pulverization, to the bulk-scale through shear and compaction band development. The evolution of these structures as a function of microscopic and macroscopic stress states and evolution is a key pursuit of rock mechanics. Success in this pursuit may enable development of robust mechanism-based constitutive models and progress in evaluating long standing questions related to associativity and other aspects of plasticity laws for rocks (Menéndez et al., 1996; Tengattini et al., 2014; Wong et al., 1997).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Dislocation slip has long been observed to be an intermittent, scale-bridging phenomenon, similar to that seen in earthquakes but at the nanoscale, leading to the speculation that large stress bursts might promote the initial opening of a crack. Here we observe such stress bursts at the scale of individual grains in situ, using high energy X-ray diffraction microscopy in Ti–7Al–O alloys.

By contrast, the addition of trace O interstitials is beneficial, reducing the magnitude of slip bursts and promoting a higher frequency of smaller events.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This work presents a structural study of shock-compressed states in Ag to 331 GPa, accessed via laser shock compression. Structures of the resulting crystalline phases and the average atomic distribution of the liquid state are determined using in situ x-ray diffraction. We employ structure factor analysis, adapted for a non-monochromatic x-ray source, to determine the density of the liquid phase from analysis of x-ray diffraction data for the first time in shock compressed Ag. We also present a detailed analysis of the crystalline phases, which shows good agreement with the phase boundaries reported in previous experimental and theoretical works. We utilize the whole powder pattern fitting approach implemented in the MAUD package to constrain stacking faults in the face centered cubic structure. We observe the ambient fcc structure up to a stress of 146 GPa before a transition to a body-centered cubic structure and liquid phase at 179 GPa, with full melting above 212 GPa.</jats:p>",
